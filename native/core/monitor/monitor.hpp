// A promiscuous receiver: every burst heard as a packet dump, whoever it is
// for (data2g-monitor, the GUI's Monitor window). Nothing here transmits.
//
// Everything on air is plain (docs/arq.md §2): the scrambler is unkeyed and
// a mask only decides whose CRC check passes. So a burst is read under every
// mask it might carry, in order: a broadcast group's (the control names it,
// docs/broadcast.md §2), mask 0 (CONNECT, CONNECT_ACK, CQ and ID frames),
// then each session key learned from a CONNECT or an ID frame, both
// directions. A connected-mode burst under a known key is followed as its
// receiver would: resends mapped from the other side's last ACK, each
// direction's codewords reassembled in seq order and inflated, so the dump
// shows the host bytes. A burst no mask fits is dumped raw, unverified.
